        <p class="hero-lead">
          When you travel, a credit card is not just a way to pay. It’s also a source of FX fees, insurance, lounge access,
          and sometimes stress if something goes wrong. This page looks at cards from the traveller’s point of view.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Matters for a Traveller Is Different</h2>
      <p>
        Many card marketing pages talk about points and flashy perks. Travellers often care more about basics:
        will the card work reliably abroad, how much do foreign purchases really cost, and what happens if a flight
        or bag goes wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of starting with “which card is best”, it can be easier to start with simple traveller questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Which card will I actually use to tap or insert at terminals abroad?</li>
        <li>Which card carries my travel insurance and delay protections?</li>
        <li>Do I have a backup if one network or card is declined?</li>
        <li>Can I see and block transactions easily in the app while on the road?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once you have those answers, comparing products on a hub like Choose.Creditcard becomes much clearer.
      </p>

    <!-- Checklist -->
    <section id="checklist" class="section">
      <h2>Practical Card Checklist Before a Trip</h2>
      <p>
        Before leaving, many experienced travellers run through a simple, repeatable checklist. It is less about
        chasing “perfect” rewards and more about avoiding predictable problems:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>FX fees:</strong> Know which of your cards charge foreign-transaction fees and which do not.</li>
        <li><strong>PIN & contactless:</strong> Make sure you have a working PIN and at least one card with chip + contactless.</li>
        <li><strong>Insurance trigger:</strong> If travel insurance requires you to pay with the card, check that you actually did.</li>
        <li><strong>Limits:</strong> Review credit limits and daily ATM limits so you are not stuck at check-in.</li>
        <li><strong>App access:</strong> Confirm you can log into the app from abroad and receive security codes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        None of these points are exciting, but they are often what decides whether a trip feels smooth or difficult
        when something unexpected happens.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Risks & backups -->
    <section id="risks" class="section">
      <h2>Risk Management and Backup Cards</h2>
      <p>
        Travellers are exposed to a few recurring risks: lost cards, blocked payments, compromised details, or delayed flights.
        A simple way to handle this is to build in redundancy:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>At least two cards</strong> stored separately (for example, one in your wallet and one in your bag or hotel safe).</li>
        <li><strong>Two different networks</strong> where possible (for example, Visa + Mastercard) to handle local acceptance quirks.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear emergency plan</strong> for how to contact your issuer if a card is lost or cloned.</li>
        <li><strong>Awareness of cash access</strong> – which card you will actually use at ATMs and what fee structure applies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Rewards can still matter, but for travellers the primary job of the card setup is to keep trips functional,
        predictable and as stress-free as possible.

        These roles can be on one or several physical cards. The point is to know which card you rely on for which job.
